### Task 17: Introduction to Virtual Reality (VR)

#### What is Virtual Reality (VR)?

Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that creates a completely artificial environment for users. When we wear a VR headset, we are placed inside a digital world that can look and feel real. we can interact with this environment using special controllers.

#### What is Augmented Reality (AR)?

Augmented Reality (AR) adds digital information (like pictures, sounds, or data) to the real world. Unlike VR, AR does not make you enter a new world, but instead, it enhances the real world.
